A stable client refers to a person living with HIV who is on Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) and demonstrates good adherence to their medication. As a stable client, you do not require frequent clinical consultations.
For clients who are stable, a differentiated care model is often implemented. Under this model, they typically attend clinical consultations every 6 months.
Viral load refers to the amount of virus present in your body. It is measured in copies per milliliter (cp/ml). A high viral load indicates a significant amount of the virus in your body. This means the results show a value higher than 836 cp/ml. On the other hand, a low detectable viral load (LDL VL) refers to results with a number less than 800 cp/ml. It suggests a lower amount of the virus present.
When we talk about a suppressed viral load, it means that the results show a value under the 800 cp/ml mark. This is similar to a low detectable viral load (LDL), indicating that the amount of virus in your blood is kept below that threshold. On the other hand, an undetectable viral load means that the HIV virus in your blood is at an extremely low level. It's so low that it cannot be reliably measured using the available tests. However, it's important to note that even though it's undetectable, it doesn't mean the virus is completely gone from your body.
You should visit the facility ,so that they can be immediately get started on Art treatment.
The frequency of viral load sample collection depends on your stability as a client. Typically, for stable clients, it is recommended to have a viral load test every 3 months. However, for clients who may be facing challenges with medication adherence or experiencing instability, the treatment provider will provide guidance on the appropriate frequency based on your individual circumstances and how well you are adhering to taking your medication.
Focus on calorie-dense and nutrient-rich foods like healthy fats (avocado, olive oil), complex carbohydrates (brown rice, quinoa), and lean protein sources (chicken, fish, beans). Consider adding healthy snacks throughout the day and aim for slightly larger portion sizes at meals.
Yes, certain supplements can interact with HIV medications. Never take any supplements without consulting your doctor or pharmacist to avoid potential interactions or complications.
Discuss alternative options with your doctor. Liquid formulations of some HIV medications may be available depending on the specific medication.

Candidiasis, also commonly referred to as thrush, is a fungal infection caused by an overgrowth of the yeast Candida albicans. This yeast naturally lives in small amounts in your mouth, digestive tract, and on your skin. In healthy individuals, the immune system and other bacteria keep the growth of Candida in check.
Oral thrush can cause white patches on your tongue or cheeks, burning mouth sensation, and difficulty swallowing. Genital thrush can cause itching, irritation, discharge (females), and redness (both males and females).
Candidiasis can be caused by a weakened immune system, antibiotics disrupting mouth/vaginal bacteria, uncontrolled diabetes, dry mouth, infants/older adults with immature/weakened immune systems, hormonal changes (pregnancy, menstruation, menopause), a diet high in sugar/refined carbs, or poorly fitting dentures.
Candidiasis is treated with antifungal medications such as clotrimazole, nystatin, miconazole, or fluconazole.
Cryptococcosis is a fungal infection caused by the Cryptococcus species, primarily Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii. This infection often occurs in people with weakened immune systems, such as those with HIV/AIDS.
Cryptococcosis can manifest in different ways depending on the affected area: Pulmonary cryptococcosis mimics pneumonia with cough, shortness of breath, and chest pain. ,Cryptococcal meningitis (most common in immunocompromised individuals) causes headache, fever, neck stiffness, nausea, vomiting, confusion, and vision problems., Disseminated cryptococcosis can affect skin, bones, the genitourinary tract, or the prostate gland, causing various symptoms depending on the involved organ.
Cryptococcosis is treated with antifungal medications like fluconazole, itraconazole, or amphotericin B. The treatment duration varies depending on the severity and location of the infection. In immunocompromised individuals, lifelong antifungal therapy might be needed to prevent relapse.
Histoplasmosis is a lung infection caused by inhaling fungal spores, leading to flu-like symptoms.
Histoplasmosis can cause mild or severe symptoms depending on the case: Mild cases often have no symptoms or flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, and fatigue., Severe cases can cause serious lung infections, and in some cases, spread to other parts of the body (disseminated histoplasmosis), leading to symptoms like chest pain, shortness of breath, weight loss, and night sweats.
Mild cases of Histoplasmosis might resolve without treatment.  Severe or chronic cases typically require antifungal medications such as itraconazole or amphotericin B. Early detection and treatment are important, especially for individuals with weakened immune systems.
Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) is a type of pneumonia common in people with weakened immune systems, causing difficulty breathing, fever, and cough. It is caused by the fungus Pneumocystis jirovecii.
Symptoms of Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) include difficulty breathing (shortness of breath, rapid breathing), fever, dry cough (may worsen with activity), and fatigue.
The mainstay treatment for Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) is Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX). Alternative medications like atovaquone, pentamidine, or clind.
Coccidioidomycosis also known as Valley fever is a fungal infection that can cause flu-like symptoms, skin rashes, and joint pain.
Coccidioidomycosis is caused by Inhaling spores from the fungus Coccidioides immitis or Coccidioides posadasii found in soil in arid regions of the southwestern United States, northern Mexico, and parts of Central and South America.
Symptoms of Coccidioidomycosis include Fever ,Cough, Fatigue, Shortness of breath, Headache, Chills, Night sweats, Joint aches and Muscle soreness.
Antifungal medications like fluconazole or itraconazole are typically used for treatment of Coccidioidomycosis depending on the severity of the infection. In severe cases, amphotericin B may be necessary.
Cytomegalovirus CMV is a virus that can cause severe eye infections, leading to blindness, and can also affect other organs.
Symptoms of Cytomegalovirus (CMV) in this case can include vision problems, digestive issues, neurological problems, fever, weight loss, and night sweats.
Antiviral medications like ganciclovir, valganciclovir, or foscarnet are used to treat Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections, especially in immunocompromised individuals. Treatment duration depends on the severity of the infection and the affected organ system.
Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is a virus causing painful sores around the mouth or genitals.
Types of Herpes simplex virus (HSV)are: HSV-1: This type typically causes oral herpes, also known as cold sores or fever blisters. These usually appear around the mouth or lips. HSV-2: This type is the most common cause of genital herpes, with sores appearing on the genitals, buttocks, or thighs.
The initial infection with HSV can cause flu-like symptoms, swollen lymph nodes, and the first outbreak of blisters or sores. Recurrent outbreaks can occur throughout life, triggered by stress, illness, or sun exposure. These outbreaks typically have milder symptoms than the initial infection.
There is no cure for HSV, but antiviral medications can shorten the duration and severity of outbreaks. Acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir are commonly used antiviral medications for HSV.
Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is a virus that causes chickenpox and shingles, leading to painful skin rashes and blisters.
Symptoms of Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) include: Fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, followed by an itchy, blistering rash that starts on the face and trunk and spreads to the rest of the body. The blisters eventually scab over and heal.
Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a virus that can cause warts and is linked to cancers of the cervix, anus, and throat.
Many HPV strains cause no symptoms and clear up on their own, Some strains cause the development of warts, which can be: Genital warts: Soft, fleshy bumps that appear on the genitals or anus, Common warts: Rough, raised bumps on the hands or fingers and Plantar warts: Hard, wart-like growths on the soles of the feet.
Human papillomavirus itself doesn't have a cure, but your body can clear it. Treatments target the effects: genital warts (medications, freezing, etc.) and abnormal Pap smears (colposcopy, cell removal). Vaccination is key for prevention, and regular checkups are crucial for early detection. Talk to your doctor for specifics.
Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a rare, often fatal, brain infection that leads to severe neurological symptoms.
PML is caused by the JC virus (JCV), a polyomavirus that infects most people in childhood but remains dormant in the body. In individuals with weakened immune systems, the JC virus can reactivate and attack the myelin sheath, the protective layer surrounding nerve fibers in the brain. This damage disrupts nerve signals and leads to progressive neurological symptoms.
Symptoms of Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) include Speech difficulties, slurring, or difficulty finding words, Memory problems, confusion, and difficulty thinking and Personality changes, mood swings, behavioral problems and Seizures (in some cases).
Medications to treat symptoms of Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) Anticonvulsants for seizures, pain medication, or medications for cognitive difficulties. Supportive care: Occupational therapy, speech therapy, and physical therapy can help individuals maintain function and independence for as long as possible.
Tuberculosis (TB) is a serious infection that primarily affects the lungs but can also impact other parts of the body. It causes a persistent cough, fever, and weight loss.
Types of Tuberculosis (TB): 1. Pulmonary TB, this is the most common form, affecting the lungs. 2.Extrapulmonary TB: When the infection spreads beyond the lungs to other parts of the body like the lymph nodes, bones, brain, or kidneys.
The symptoms of Tuberculosis (TB) include: A persistent cough (lasting for more than 3 weeks) is the hallmark symptom of TB. Other common symptoms include: Fever, Night sweats, Unexplained weight loss, Fatigue, Loss of appetite, Chest pain (especially with coughing or deep breathing), Shortness of breath and Hemoptysis (coughing up blood).
TB is a treatable disease. Treatment involves a combination of antibiotics taken for several months to ensure complete eradication of the bacteria. It's crucial to complete the entire course of antibiotics, even if symptoms improve, to prevent drug resistance.
Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) is a group of bacteria that can cause widespread infection in the body, particularly affecting the lungs and intestines, leading to symptoms like fever, weight loss, and diarrhea.
The symptoms of MAC infection can vary depending on the affected organ system. Here's a breakdown of common presentations: Pulmonary MAC (most common): Mimics chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with symptoms like: Persistent cough, Shortness of breath, Fatigue, Weight loss, Low-grade fever and Night sweats. Disseminated MAC (less common): The bacteria can spread beyond the lungs to various parts of the body, causing symptoms depending on the location: Swollen lymph nodes, Fever, chills, and night sweats, Abdominal pain, diarrhea, or weight loss (if intestines involved), Skin lesions and Bone or joint pain.
Treatment for MAC infection typically involves a combination of antibiotics taken for months, sometimes even years, to eradicate the bacteria completely. The specific antibiotic regimen depends on the severity and location of the infection.
Salmonella is a group of bacteria commonly found in the intestines of animals, including poultry, cattle, pigs, and even reptiles. Humans become infected by consuming contaminated food or water containing Salmonella bacteria.
Salmonellosis is an infection caused by Salmonella bacteria, leading to diarrhea, fever, and abdominal cramps.
Diarrhea (may be bloody), Fever, Abdominal cramps, Nausea and vomiting, Headache and Muscle aches.
In most cases, treatment of Salmonella focuses on managing symptoms and preventing dehydration. This may involve: o Restoring fluids and electrolytes through oral rehydration solutions or intravenous fluids in severe cases. o Over-the-counter medications to relieve fever and pain (use caution with pain relievers in children). Antibiotics can also be used to treat it.
Bacterial pneumonia is a lung infection that causes fever, cough, and difficulty breathing.
Several types of bacteria can cause pneumonia. The most common cause of pneumonia in the United States is Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus), but others like Haemophilus influenzae and Legionella pneumophila can also be responsible.
Symptoms of Bacterial pneumonia Productive cough (coughing up mucus) that may be green, yellow, or blood-tinged, Fever and chills, Shortness of breath or rapid breathing, Sharp chest pain that worsens with coughing or deep breathing, Fatigue, Loss of appetite and Confusion, especially in older adults
Bacterial pneumonia is treated with antibiotics. The specific antibiotic chosen depends on the type of bacteria identified through the sputum culture. Most cases can be treated with oral antibiotics at home, but severe cases requiring hospitalization and intravenous antibiotics may occur. Supportive measures like pain relievers for fever and chest pain, and oxygen therapy for individuals with difficulty breathing, may also be necessary.
Toxoplasmosis Caused by a parasite called Toxoplasma gondii. Infection can occur through contact with cat feces (infected cats shed the parasite in their stool) or by consuming undercooked meat containing the parasite cysts.
In severe cases, especially for people with weakened immune systems, toxoplasmosis can cause: Inflammation of the brain (encephalitis) - This can lead to headaches, confusion, seizures, and other neurological problems. Eye problems - Inflammation of the retina (toxoplasmic retinochoroiditis) can cause blurred vision, eye pain, and even vision loss.
Antibiotic medications are used to treat toxoplasmosis infection, especially in pregnant women and individuals with weakened immune systems.
Cryptosporidiosis is a parasitic infection that primarily affects the intestines and causes unpleasant gastrointestinal issues. Cryptosporidiosis is caused by a microscopic parasite called Cryptosporidium. This parasite lives in the intestines of infected humans and animals.
Symptoms of Cryptosporidiosis include: Stomach cramps and abdominal pain, Nausea and vomiting, Loss of appetite, Weight loss (in severe cases) and Low-grade fever (may not always be present).
Cryptosporidiosis can be treated focusing on managing symptoms and preventing dehydration. This may involve: Oral rehydration solutions to replenish fluids and electrolytes lost due to diarrhea, Antidiarrheal medications (not always recommended) and Rest and dietary changes.
Isosporiasis is a parasitic infection of the intestines causing diarrhea, fever, and weight loss.
Isosporiasis is caused by a single-celled parasite called Cystoisospora belli. This parasite infects the intestinal wall and disrupts nutrient absorption.
Symptoms of Isosporiasis include: Abdominal cramps and pain, Nausea and vomiting, Fever (may not always be present), Weight loss (due to poor nutrient absorption) and Fatigue and malaise.
Isosporiasis can treated by focusing on managing symptoms and preventing dehydration. This may involve: o Oral rehydration solutions to replenish fluids and electrolytes lost due to diarrhea and Antidiarrheal medications (not always recommended) and Antiparasitic medications like trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in some cases, especially for immunocompromised individuals and Rest and dietary changes.
Microsporidiosis is an infection caused by microscopic parasites leading to diarrhea and wasting.
Microsporidiosis is caused by a group of microscopic parasites called microsporidia. These parasites are obligate intracellular parasites, meaning they can only live and reproduce inside the cells of their host.
Symptoms of Microsporidiosis include: Abdominal pain and cramping, Loss of appetite and weight loss (due to malabsorption), Fatigue and malaise and Fever (may not always be present).
Antiparasitic medications like albendazole or nitazoxanide, Antiretroviral therapy (ART) for individuals with HIV/AIDS, as a strengthened immune system can better fight off the infection. and Supportive measures to manage symptoms and prevent complications, such as oral rehydration solutions and dietary modifications.
